# Next Steps - DHIS2 Charting

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All backend code changes and database migrations are complete. The Superset backend is running successfully on port 8088.

## 🚀 To Start Using DHIS2 Charts

### Step 1: Fix Frontend Build (Required)

The frontend has a webpack compatibility issue with Node.js v22. Run this script to fix it:

```bash
cd /Users/stephocay/projects/hispuganda/superset
./fix-frontend.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Installs Node.js v20 (LTS) via nvm
- Cleans and reinstalls frontend dependencies
- Starts the development server

**If nvm isn't installed**, the script will install it and ask you to restart your terminal.

### Step 2: Access Superset

Once the frontend is running:

```
http://localhost:8088
```

Login with your admin credentials.

### Step 3: Create Your First Chart

1. **Navigate** to your DHIS2 dataset
2. **Click** "Create Chart"
3. **Select** chart type:
   - For regional analysis: "Bar Chart"
   - For time series: "Time-series Line Chart"
   - For multi-dimensional: "Pivot Table"
4. **Configure**:
   - X-Axis: Select `OrgUnit` (for regional) or `Period` (for time series)
   - Metrics: Select your data elements (e.g., `SUM(Malaria Cases)`)
   - Filters: Add filters as needed (e.g., `Period = "202401"`)
5. **Run Query** and save!

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Can I use OrgUnit as the X-axis now?
**A**: Yes! ✅ Use "Bar Chart" (not "Time-series Bar Chart") and select OrgUnit as X-axis.

### Q: Do I need a datetime column?
**A**: No! ✅ DHIS2 datasets work without datetime columns. Period can be used as a filter or dimension.

### Q: Why is the frontend not loading?
**A**: Node.js v22 is not compatible. Run `./fix-frontend.sh` to install v20.

### Q: Are my data elements in separate columns?
**A**: Yes! ✅ The wide/horizontal format shows each data element as its own column.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Frontend won't build**:
```bash
./fix-frontend.sh
```

**Backend not running**:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH=/Users/stephocay/projects/hispuganda/superset/superset_config.py
superset run -p 8088
```

**Migration not applied**:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH=/Users/stephocay/projects/hispuganda/superset/superset_config.py
superset db upgrade
```
